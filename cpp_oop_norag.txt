**Topic 0: Inheritance and Polymorphism in C++**

**Problem Description:**
The problem involves demonstrating an understanding of inheritance and polymorphism in C++ by implementing a simple hierarchy of classes representing animals and their sounds.

**Problem Statement:**
Write a C++ program using inheritance and polymorphism to create a base class "Animal" with a virtual function "sound()" and derive a class "Dog" from it. Override the "sound()" function in the derived class to specify the sound made by a dog. Instantiate a pointer of the base class type pointing to a derived class object and demonstrate polymorphism by calling the "sound()" function.

**Student Solution Evaluation:**
1. **Correct use of OOP Principles (30 points):**
   - The student has demonstrated a good understanding of OOP principles by utilizing inheritance and polymorphism effectively.
   - The "Animal" class is a base class with a virtual function "sound()". This allows for polymorphic behavior, where the derived class can provide its own implementation.
   - The "Dog" class inherits publicly from "Animal", indicating an "is-a" relationship. This allows a "Dog" object to

**Topic 1: Encapsulation and Abstraction in C++**

**Problem Description and Statement:**
Encapsulation and abstraction are fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP). Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit, such as a class. It helps protect the data from direct manipulation and provides a controlled interface for interaction. Abstraction, on the other hand, involves hiding complex implementation details and exposing only the essential features of an object. This promotes code simplicity, maintainability, and flexibility. The problem statement is to evaluate and provide feedback on a student's C++ code demonstrating encapsulation and abstraction by creating a simple bank account class with a deposit function and a balance inquiry method.

**Detailed Evaluation:**
- OOP Principles (30 points):
    - The student's solution effectively demonstrates the principle of encapsulation by encapsulating the 'balance' attribute within the 'BankAccount' class. The attribute is marked as 'private', ensuring that it cannot be directly accessed or modified from outside the class.
    - Abstraction is also demonstrated by providing a simplified interface for interacting with the bank account. The user of the
