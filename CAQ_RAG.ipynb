      "## Problem: Zoo Management System\n",
      "\n",
      "**Background:** \n",
      "You are developing a software system to manage animals and employees in a zoo. The zoo has a wide variety of animals, and you need to create a flexible and extensible system to handle their data and interactions. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Requirements:**\n",
      "Develop a Java program that utilizes inheritance and polymorphism to model the zoo management system. Your program should include the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Animals and Employees:**\n",
      "   - Create a superclass `LivingBeing` that stores common attributes like name, age, and health status. This superclass should also have methods like `eat()`, `move()`, and `getDescription()`.\n",
      "   - Define subclasses for specific types of animals (e.g., `Mammal`, `Bird`, `Reptile`) and employees (e.g., `Zookeeper`, `Vet`) that inherit from `LivingBeing`. Override appropriate methods and add new ones specific to each subclass.\n",
      "2. **Food and Movement:**\n",
      "   - Implement polymorphism for the `eat()` method. Different types of animals should eat different types of food (e..g\n",
      "Evaluation:\n",
      " Evaluation based on the provided rubric:\n",
      "1. Correct use of inheritance (30 points):\n",
      "   - The student's code demonstrates a good understanding of inheritance. They have created a superclass `Animal` and a subclass `Dog` that extends `Animal`. The `sound()` method is correctly overridden in the `Dog` class, exhibiting polymorphic behavior.\n",
      "   - The student correctly utilizes method overriding to provide specific implementations for the `sound()` method in both the superclass and subclass.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Implementation of polymorphic behavior (30 points):\n",
      "   - The student effectively demonstrates polymorphic behavior in their code. In the `Main` class, an `Animal` reference variable (`obj`) is used to refer to a `Dog` object. When `obj.sound()` is called, the appropriate method in the `Dog` class is invoked due to polymorphism.\n",
      "   - This showcases the power of inheritance and dynamic method dispatch, earning full points in this category.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Code readability and comments (20 points): \n",
      "   - The student's code is well-organized and follows a clear structure. The class and method names are descriptive, making the code self-explanatory. \n",
      "   - However, the code could benefit from some comments explaining the purpose of each class and method. A\n",

      "I've reviewed your Java code submission, and I'm pleased to provide you with some feedback based on the provided rubric. Overall, your understanding of inheritance and polymorphic behavior is evident, and you should be proud of the work you've accomplished. \n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths:\n",
      "- **Correct Use of Inheritance (30/30)**: Well done! You've demonstrated a solid grasp of inheritance by creating a superclass `Animal` and a subclass `Dog`. The `sound()` method is effectively overridden in the `Dog` class, showcasing your understanding of polymorphism. This shows that you can create extensible and hierarchical relationships between classes, which is a cornerstone of object-oriented programming. \n",
      "- **Implementation of Polymorphic Behavior (30/30)**: Your code elegantly displays polymorphic behavior. By using an `Animal` reference variable (`obj`) to refer to a `Dog` object, you've exhibited the power of dynamic method dispatch. This is a key concept in Java, and you've applied it successfully. \n",
      "\n",
      "## Areas for Improvement:\n",
      "- **Code Readability and Comments (20/20)**: Your code is well-organized, structured, and easy to follow, which are essential qualities for maintainable software\n"
