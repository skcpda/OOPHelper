Problem Statement:
Create a class hierarchy for geometric shapes to demonstrate inheritance and polymorphism in C++. The goal is to calculate the areas of various shapes and showcase the ability to handle different forms of calculations using a single function call.

Problem Scenario:
You are developing a graphics application that needs to calculate the areas of various geometric shapes accurately. The application should be designed using object-oriented principles, incorporating inheritance and polymorphism to ensure code reusability and flexibility.

Base Class:
Create a base class named "Shape" that includes a pure virtual function to calculate the area. The pure virtual function will serve as an abstract interface for all derived shapes. Here's a code snippet to get you started:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Shape {
public:
    virtual double calculateArea() const = 0; // Pure virtual function
};
```

Derived Classes:
Create at least three derived classes from the "Shape" base class: "Circle," "Rectangle," and "Triangle." Each derived class should override the "calculateArea" function to provide the

Problem for Topic 8 (File Handling in C++):
Here is a detailed programming problem for a C++ class on file handling, along with instructional content, a problem statement, rubric, deliverables, and requirements:
## Instructional Content:
### 1. Introduction to File Handling in C++:
- Programs become truly powerful when they can interact with data beyond simple user input. File handling allows programs to store and retrieve data, enabling persistence and data processing.
- In C++, file handling is typically done using the `fstream` class, which treats files as streams of bytes, providing an interface for reading and writing.

### 2. Classes for File Stream Operations:
- The `fstream` class is a part of the C++ Standard Library and is defined in the `<fstream>` header file. It provides a way to work with files and includes constructors, a destructor, and overloaded operators for convenient usage.
- Related classes include `ifstream` (for input operations) and `ofstream` (for output operations). These classes inherit from the `fstream` class and specialize in a particular type of file operation.

### 3. Opening and Closing a File:
- Before performing any file operations, you must open the file using the `open()` function.

Student Solution for Topic 8:

        #include <iostream>
        #include <fstream>
        using namespace std;

        int main() {
            ofstream outFile("example.txt");
            outFile << "Hello, file!" << endl;
            outFile.close();

            ifstream inFile("example.txt");
            string content;
            getline(inFile, content);
            cout << "Read from file: " << content << endl;
            inFile.close();

            return 0;
        }
        

Evaluation for Topic 8:
Here is a detailed evaluation of the student's code submission based on the provided rubric:
### 1. Correct use of OOP principles (30 points):
- The code demonstrates a basic understanding of Object-Oriented Programming principles. The student has utilized the `ifstream` and `ofstream` classes, which are derived from the `fstream` base class, to perform file input and output operations.

Problem for Topic 10 (Design Patterns: Singleton and Factory):
Here is a detailed programming problem for a C++ course on design patterns, focusing on the Singleton and Factory patterns:
## Problem Statement:
You are tasked with designing a robust and flexible number generation system for 246 Lovely Professional University. This system will be used to generate unique identification numbers for various entities within the university, such as students, faculty, and staff. The goal is to implement this system using the Singleton and Factory design patterns to ensure efficient memory usage and promote code reusability.

## Requirements:
1. **Singleton Design Pattern**: Implement a class `UniqueNumberGenerator` that follows the Singleton design pattern. Ensure that only one instance of this class can be created. The instance should be accessible globally and provide a method `generateUniqueNumber()` that returns a unique identification number. The numbers should be generated sequentially, starting from 1001.

2. **Factory Design Pattern**: Create a factory class `NumberFactory` that encapsulates the creation of different types of unique number generators. This factory should have a method `createNumberGenerator(const std::string& type)` that takes a string parameter indicating the type of number generator requested ("student", "faculty", or "staff"). Each type should generate numbers from a unique sequence,
